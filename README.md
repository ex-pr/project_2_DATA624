# Project 2: Predicting pH for ABC Beverage

### DATA 624 Fall 2024 

This repository contains the work of a team of data scientists tasked with understanding the manufacturing process at ABC Beverage. The project aims to:

- Identify predictive factors affecting pH levels in the manufacturing process.

- Build and report a predictive model for pH.

- Provide insights through technical and non-technical reports.

The project is part of an assignment simulating a real-world scenario under regulatory compliance.

## **How to Use**

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Input the Data**:

   - Place the provided dataset(s) (StudentEvaluation.xlsx, StudentData.xlsx) in the data/ folder of the repository.
   
   - Ensure the dataset file names match the references in the analysis scripts.
   
   - Verify the integrity of the datasets and ensure they align with the expected format.
   
3. **Run the Code**:

   - Open the .Rmd files in RStudio to view the full analysis and generate reports.
   
   - Make sure all required R packages are installed (see [Requirements](#requirements) section).

4. **View the Reports**:

   - Access the non-technical and technical reports via the Rpubs links provided in the repository.
   
   - These reports summarize key findings, the modeling process, and final recommendations.

5. **Prediction Results**:

   - The Excel file (predictions.xlsx) in the repository contains the predicted pH values generated by the final model.
   
   - Use these predictions for further decision-making or validation.

## **Requirements**

The analysis was performed using:

- **R version**: >= 4.0

- **Key R packages**:

  - `tidyverse`
  
  - `caret`
  
  - `forecast`
  
  - `randomForest`
  
  - `ggplot2`
  
  - `readxl`
  
  - `xlsx`

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the scripts. Use the `install.packages()` function in R to install any missing libraries.

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Preparation**:

   - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2. **EDA**:

   - Explored data distributions, relationships, and identified key variables affecting pH.
   
   - Visualized insights using plots and statistical summaries.

3. **Modeling**:

   - Tested multiple models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   
   - Selected the best-performing model based on metrics such as RÂ², RMSE, and MAPE.

4. **Reporting**:

   - Created technical and non-technical reports to present findings in a format suitable for both data scientists and business stakeholders.

## **Deliverables**

1. **Technical Report**:

   - Includes a detailed analysis of the methods, models, and evaluation metrics.
   
   - Provided via an Rpubs link.

2. **Non-Technical Report**:

   - Summarizes insights in a business-friendly format, focusing on actionable recommendations.
   
   - Provided via an Rpubs link.

3. **Prediction Results**:

   - An Excel file containing the predicted pH values generated by the final model.
