# Overview & Introduction

## **Objective:**

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the beverage manufacturing process at the ABC Beverage company. This is done by completing an expansive evaluation of pH levels, which consists of preliminary data analysis and scrupulous model selection for predicting pH levels in the manufacturing process.

## **Introduction:**
We began this analysis by looking into which variable would present issues for the model. There was a glaring problem with the state of the original beverage data. Variables Brand Code and MFR were missing 4.5% and 8.2% of data respectively. Following the discovery of missingness,the group moved to further evaluate the data through thorough exploratory data analysis. Within the EDA we confirmed that the dataset contained missing values, skewness, and outliers, with key variables like Brand Code and MFR requiring special attention in the working steps prior to modeling.

After cleaning the data we shifted our attention to building models and evaluating performance. The group ended on five handpicked models to evaluate. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, and MARS were chosen. We thought that these models would cover a range of techniques instead of focusing on one area of predictive modeling. Lastly we settled on one singular model that was more performant that any of the others.


## **Key Findings:**
Due to the high performance relative to the other four models the group chose that random forest was the best fit. While evaluating the top 10 predictors in our random forest model the mnf_flow variable stood out the most. Carrying near 45% of the importance in the model the mnf_flow is undoubtedly the most important variable, in consultation with the correlation matrix in the EDA section, we can deduce that mnf_flow is not only important but also negatively correlated with pH levels in beverage production. The model behind this discovery is a random forest model which boasts a Test R-Squared of 71.3%, a Test RMSE of 0.096 and a Test MAE of 0.069 which highlights this models accuracy and reliability in predicting pH levels.


## **Background:** 
pH is a critical quality metric in beverage production because it directly affects the flavor, safety, shelf life, and consistency of the product. Maintaining the correct pH level ensures that the beverage is resistant to microbial growth and chemical deterioration, which is essential for consumer safety and product stability. Regulatory requirements mandate that beverage manufacturers closely monitor and control pH levels to meet industry standards and ensure product quality. Non-compliance with these regulations can lead to product recalls, legal issues, and damage to the company's reputation. The FDA has a slew of resources and best practices about this.

# 1. Data Exploration

## 1.1 Load data

Data for training and evaluation are obtained from the GitHub repo via URLs, ensuring that the most recent version is used for analysis. Temporary files are used as intermediate storage to speed up the data collecting process.

```{r load_data}
#Load train data
#URL the raw .xlsx file
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ex-pr/project_2_DATA624/main/StudentData.xlsx"
#Temporary path
temp_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")
#Download file
curl_download(url, temp_file)
#Read file
data_beverage <- read_excel(temp_file)
#Copy data
beverage_df <- data_beverage
#Clean temp file
unlink(temp_file)

#Load test data
#URL the raw .xlsx file
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ex-pr/project_2_DATA624/main/StudentEvaluation.xlsx"
#Temporary path
temp_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")
#Download file
curl_download(url, temp_file)
#Read file
data_eval <- read_excel(temp_file)
#Copy data
eval_df <- data_eval
```

## 1.2 Summary Statistics

Beverage dataset: 2571 rows x 33 columns.  
Evaluation dataset: 267 rows x 33 columns.  
Mostly numeric, with one categorical variable (Brand Code).  

- NAs:  
Brand Code: ~4.7% missing in beverage_df, ~3.0% missing in eval_df.  
Many numeric features have a small percentage of missing values, generally < 2%.  
PH: 4 NAs for Brand code B, the target variable in beverage_df. eval_df has all values missing for PH (used for prediction).  
Impute missing values for numeric features using median or mean (or more advanced imputation if correlated features exist). Missing values should be handled within a robust pipeline to avoid information loss.  

- Skewness and outliers  
Variables like Mnf Flow have extreme values (mean is heavily influenced by outliers). Range: -100.2 to 229.4.  
PH: Check for extreme pH values that may affect model accuracy.  
Hyd Pressure1–4: High standard deviations (e.g., Hyd Pressure2 with a mean of ~21 and SD of 16.4).  
Analyze the distribution of these variables using histograms or boxplots. Maybe winsorization or BoxCox/log transformation for skewed distributions.

- Feature Importance for PH pred  
Carb Volume, Fill Ounces, PC Volume, Carb Pressure, and Carb Temp have small sd and are likely controlled manufacturing parameters. These might directly influence pH.  
Brand Code can be treated as a categorical predictor for brand-specific variations.  
Correlation or feature importance to identify which variables most strongly influence PH.  

- Brand Code: 4 levels (A, B, C, D).  
Unbalanced distribution: B accounts for ~50% of records, while A, C, and D are much smaller. The imbalance might affect models like decision trees or ensemble methods.  
Apply stratified sampling or weighting to handle imbalance during training. Explore interaction effects between Brand Code and numeric variables.

- Multicollinearity  
Variables such as Carb Volume, PC Volume, and Carb Pressure might be correlated due to their role in carbonation.  
Multiple pressure-related variables (Carb Pressure1, Fill Pressure, etc.) and filler speed/level metrics could also have collinear relationships.  
Compute a correlation matrix to detect highly correlated predictors.  

- Data Leakage  
Variables like PSC, PSC Fill, and PSC CO could be downstream measures dependent on pH. Confirm whether these are part of the production process or outcome metrics.  
Analyze the production process to ensure no data leakage into the model.

- eval_df  
All PH values are missing for prediction.  
Structure and missingness are similar to beverage_df. Ensure preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines are consistent between training and evaluation datasets.

## 1.3 EDA 

### Featured Variables:

**Carb Volume:** Volume of the beverage that is carbonated.  
**Fill Ounces:** Volume of the beverage filled into containers, measured in ounces.  
**PC Volume:** Could indicate "Process Control Volume," a measure related to production parameters.  
**Carb Pressure:** Pressure used during the carbonation process.  
**Carb Temp:** Temperature of the beverage during carbonation.  
**PSC:** Potentially a quality control metric, the exact meaning would depend on industry context.  
**PSC Fill:** Quality or quantity metric related to the filling process.  
**PSC CO2:** Measures CO2 levels or pressure during processing.  
**Mnf Flow:** Manufacturing flow rate, likely related to how fast the production line operates.  
**Carb Pressure1:** Another measurement of pressure during carbonation, possibly at a different production stage.  
**Fill Pressure:** Pressure maintained during the filling of beverages into containers.  
**Hyd Pressure1, Hyd Pressure2, Hyd Pressure3, Hyd Pressure4:** Different points of hydraulic pressure measurement within the machinery.  
**Filler Level:** Level to which containers are filled; critical for consistency.  
**Filler Speed:** Speed at which the filling machinery operates.  
**Temperature:** General temperature measurement.  
**Carb Flow:** Flow rate of the carbonation process.  
**Density:** Physical density of the beverage, which impacts taste and mouth feel.  
**MFR:** Manufacturer’s reference; could relate to specific production settings or machine identifiers.  
**Balling:** Measurement related to the sugar content of a liquid, typically used in brewing.    
**Pressure Vacuum:** Pressure readings from a vacuum process, possibly in packaging.  
**Oxygen Filler:** Likely measures the presence of oxygen during filling, which must be minimized in certain beverages.  
**Bowl Setpoint:** Setpoint for a particular part of the machinery, possibly related to mixing or blending.  
**Pressure Setpoint:** Target pressure to be maintained within certain machinery or process stages.  
**Air Pressurer:** Air pressure readings.  
**Alch Rel:** Could be "Alcohol Release" or related to the alcohol content management.  
**Carb Rel:** Possibly "Carbonation Reliability" or a similar measure of carbonation consistency.  
**Balling Lvl:** Specific gravity of the liquid related to its sugar content, important in quality control in brewing and beverage manufacturing.

### EDA Takeaways:

The pH of a solution is measured on a scale from 0 to 14, indicating its acidity or alkalinity. In beverage manufacturing, maintaining the correct pH level is crucial for ensuring flavor, safety, shelf life, and uniformity.

The data shows that the most common pH level is around 8.5, which appears to be the target for many batches of beverages. For carbonated beverages, a slightly alkaline pH level can:
- **Improve Taste:** Balance the tang of carbonation with a smoother, less acidic flavor.
- **Aid in Shelf Stability:** Ensure the beverage is resistant to microbial growth and chemical deterioration.
- **Reflect Process Consistency:** Indicate consistent raw material quality, carbonation levels, and filling precision.

The distribution of pH is roughly normal with a slight negative skew, centered around 8.5, and includes some outliers at both the lower and upper tails.

Brand B has significantly more entries compared to other brands, suggesting the need for balancing or stratified sampling during model training. The pH distribution varies across Brand Codes, with Brand C having the lowest median pH and Brand B the highest. Outliers are present in all brand codes, and it is important to investigate whether these outliers are due to measurement errors or valid extreme cases.


```{r ph_plots}
#Distribution PH plot
ggplot(beverage_df, aes(x = PH)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, fill = "lightgreen", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of PH", x = "PH", y = "Frequency")

#Distribution Brand Code plot
ggplot(beverage_df, aes(x = `Brand Code`)) +

  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Count by Brand Code", x = "Brand Code", y = "Count")

filtered_df <- beverage_df %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Brand Code`))

#Boxplot brand code vs ph
ggplot(filtered_df, aes(x = `Brand Code`, y = PH, fill = `Brand Code`)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of PH by Brand Code", x = "Brand Code", y = "PH")
```

### EDA - Distributions:

Several variables in the dataset exhibit notable characteristics and potential issues:

- **Outliers:** MFR, Fill Speed, Hyd Pressure3, and Pressure Setpoint contain outliers that may need to be addressed.
- **Bimodal Distribution:** Variables such as Alch Rel, Balling, and Balling Lvl show bimodal distributions, suggesting that binning might be necessary.
- **Long-Tailed Distribution:** Mnf Flow has a long-tailed distribution, which could affect model performance.
- **Sharp Peaks:** Filler Speed, Hyd Pressure2, and Usage Cont exhibit sharp peaks in their distributions.
- **Spread and Skewness:** Hyd Pressure4 shows an interesting spread, providing insights into process variability. MFR and Oxygen Filler are heavily right-skewed, indicating the need for normalization.

For variables like MFR and Usage Cont, applying log or Box-Cox transformations can help normalize their distributions.

**Mnf Flow:**
- A value of -100 appears frequently, which could indicate:
  - **Missing Data:** A common placeholder value.
  - **Domain-Specific Encoding:** For example, representing "no flow" or a specific state in manufacturing.
  - **Data Error:** A mistake in data collection or recording.
- It is essential to confirm whether -100 is a legitimate value or a placeholder. If it is a placeholder, it should be treated as missing and imputed or removed to ensure data integrity.

```

### Initial Missingness:

The dataset contains varying levels of missing values across different variables:

- **MFR:** This variable has the highest percentage of missing values at around 7%. It may be challenging to collect consistently or might not be relevant across all rows. If MFR is critical, consider using mean, median, or model-based imputation. If it does not strongly correlate with the target variable or other features, it might be best to drop it.
- **Variables with <3% Missingness:** For variables like PSC CO2 and PC Volume, which have less than 3% missing values, simple imputation techniques can be applied.
- **Brand Code:** Mode imputation is recommended for handling missing values in the Brand Code variable.

```{r na_scatterplt_ph_vs_features}
#NA
gg_miss_var(beverage_df, show_pct = TRUE)

#Choose numeric vars
numeric_vars <- beverage_df %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  names()

#Create scatter plots vs PH
for (var in numeric_vars) {
  p <- ggplot(beverage_df, aes_string(x = paste0("`", var, "`"), y = "PH")) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "blue") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = paste("Scatterplot:", var, "vs PH"), x = var, y = "PH")
  
  print(p)  # Display the plot
}

```

## 1.4 Correlation Matrix

### Preliminary Findings:

The data revealed several important correlations and potential multicollinearity issue. We used this correlation matrix to try and begin to understand the interworkings of the production process. Below is a write-up of these initial findings.

- **Intercorrelations:** Density, Balling, and Carb Rel show strong intercorrelations, which could lead to multicollinearity issues in linear regression models.
- **Negative Correlations:** Mnf Flow and Usage Cont have strong negative correlations, suggesting the need for additional preprocessing or transformation before moving to model selection.
- **Interaction Terms:** Exploring interaction terms between variables like Bowl Setpoint and Filler Level or between Pressure Vacuum and Carb Flow could provide further insights into their relationships with pH.

**Key Variable Correlations:**
- **Bowl Setpoint (correlation: 0.36):** This parameter likely affects the flow or intensity of ingredient mixing during carbonation or flavoring stages. A higher bowl setpoint may result in more uniform mixing, reducing pH variability.
- **Filler Level (correlation: 0.35):** Ensures containers are properly filled to prevent extra air or gas imbalances. Variations in filler level can influence carbonation levels and pH, so proper calibration is essential.
- **Pressure Vacuum (correlation: 0.22):** Assists with gas exchange during filling. Variations in vacuum pressure can cause inconsistent carbonation, affecting pH. Monitoring this parameter ensures the desired carbonation "bite."
- **Oxygen Filler (correlation: 0.17):** Determines the amount of oxygen introduced during filling. Higher oxygen levels can accelerate oxidation, reducing pH and compromising flavor stability. Maintaining low oxygen levels is crucial for product quality.
- **Mnf Flow (correlation: -0.45):** Describes the rate at which materials flow during production. A higher flow rate may result in irregular mixing, reduced carbonation, and a shift in pH. Adjusting flow rates helps maintain consistent product attributes.


```{r corr}
tst <- beverage_df %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric))
#Correlation with PH
cor_table <- cor(drop_na(tst))[, "PH"] %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "Variable") %>%
  rename(Coefficient = ".") %>%
  arrange(desc(Coefficient))

kable(cor_table, "html", escape = F, col.names = c('Variable', 'Coefficient')) %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
  add_header_above(c("Table 6: Correlation with PH" = 2))

#Corr matrix
rcore <- rcorr(as.matrix(tst))
coeff <- rcore$r
#Filter to include only |r| > 0.1, the rest are 0
filtered_coeff <- coeff
filtered_coeff[abs(filtered_coeff) < 0.1] <- 0 
coeff <- rcore$r
corrplot(filtered_coeff, tl.cex = .6, tl.col="black", method = 'color', addCoef.col = "black",
         type="upper", order="hclust", number.cex=0.45, diag=FALSE)
```


# 2. Data Preparation

### Identification of problem areas

- **Standardizing Column Names:**
  - Using `make_clean_names()` to eliminate issues caused by case sensitivity or spaces, making data manipulation easier and less error-prone.

- **Zero Variance Predictors:**
  - Identifying and removing zero variance predictors (e.g., Hyd Pressure1) to simplify the modeling process, boost computational efficiency, and potentially increase model performance.

- **Missing Value Imputation:**
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Fills in missing values using the average (or median) of the 'k' most similar occurrences. Ideal for large datasets with simple relationships.
  - **Random Forest Imputation:** Captures non-linear correlations by learning decision rules from other features, providing more accurate approximations than simpler methods like mode imputation.

- **Handling Mnf Flow Values:**
  - If '-100' is not a valid data point, mark it as missing and use KNN imputation to ensure replacement values reflect typical operational data, preserving consistency in the manufacturing flow analysis.

- **Outliers:**
  - Initially not adjusted to retain important information about the system's behavior under unusual conditions, which can be crucial for predictive modeling.

- **One-Hot Encoding:**
  - Converts categorical variables, such as Brand Code, into binary variables, making the model more adaptable in learning patterns unique to each category.

- **Interaction Terms and Polynomial Features:**
  - **Interaction Terms:** Simulate the effects of interactions between variables on pH levels (e.g., pc_volume_pressure).
  - **Polynomial Features:** Capture non-linear interactions (e.g., carb_volume2).

- **Binning Continuous Variables:**
  - Helps manage non-linear effects and improve model performance by transforming continuous variables into categorical ones (e.g., carb_temp_binned).

- **Transformations:**
  - **Log and Square Root Transformations:** Applied to variables like filler_speed and air_pressurer to standardize their distributions and reduce skewness.
  - Transformations help reduce variance and make data more normally distributed, enhancing the effectiveness of many statistical learning approaches that rely on normally distributed data.


## 2.1 Missing values

- Cleaning up the naming conventions in both the evaluation dataframe and out original dataset.

```{r colnames_zeroVar}
#Fix column names
colnames(beverage_df) <- make_clean_names(colnames(beverage_df))
#Apply the same to eval_df 
colnames(eval_df) <- make_clean_names(colnames(eval_df))
#Check new column names
colnames(beverage_df)

# Identify zero-variance predictors
zero_var <- nearZeroVar(beverage_df, saveMetrics = TRUE)
print(zero_var[zero_var$nzv, ])

beverage_df <- beverage_df[, !zero_var$nzv]
eval_df <- eval_df[, !zero_var$nzv]
```

**Imputing missing values**
knnImputation was used for for numeric variables and Random Forest was used for Brand Code and mnf_flow.

```{r impute_numeric}
set.seed(547)

#### Comparing newly formed and transformed variables

The team created six new transformation for six original variables in the dataset to try an improve performance. The changes were seen across both the original dataset and the eval dataset.

**Transformed Variables and the transformations applied:**
* filler_speed - (log)
* mfr - (log)
* temperature (sqrt)
* air_pressure (sqrt)
* oxygen_filter (shifted log)
* psc_co2 (shifted log)

Tables 7 and 8 were created to visualize this change in both new transformed df's.

# 3. Build Models

Splitting data into training and testing sets (via createDataPartition()). Its goal is to test the model using previously unseen data in order to predict how well it would perform in real-world circumstances. Using a stratified sampling strategy ensures that the distribution of essential variables (such as pH levels) remains consistent throughout the training and testing sets.

The use of numerous models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, and MARS) provides a comprehensive view of how various techniques perform with the provided data. 
 
MARS is a flexible non-parametric technique capable of effectively modeling nonlinearities and interactions.  
Support Vector Machine: Effective for determining the ideal border between outputs; best suited for boundary decisions rather than probability estimations. 
Neural Networks: Ideal for collecting complicated patterns in huge datasets, but may demand significant computational resources.  
Gradient Boosting: Effective for managing a variety of data kinds and gradually improves performance through boosting.  
Random Forest: Effective for handling non-linear relationships and resistant to overfitting.  

Cross-validation (specified in trainControl()) ensures that the model is rigorously validated and not tailored to a single subset of the data. Repeated cross-validation helps to reduce variance in the model evaluation process, resulting in a more accurate performance estimate. Using grids (expand.grid()) for distinct model parameters enables systematic searching through a set of alternatives to discover the ideal combination that maximizes model performance.

```{r parallel_core}
#Detect the number of available cores
numCores <- detectCores()

#Register parallel backend (use numCores - 1 to leave 1 core free for system tasks)
cl <- makeCluster(numCores - 1)
registerDoParallel(cl)
```

```{r}
#Data with new features
set.seed(123)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(beverage_revised$ph, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train_revised <- beverage_revised[trainIndex, ]
test_revised <- beverage_revised[-trainIndex, ]
eval_revised <- subset(eval_revised, select = -ph)
```

```{r}
set.seed(123)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(beverage_transformed$ph, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train_transformed <- beverage_transformed[trainIndex, ]
test_transformed <- beverage_transformed[-trainIndex, ]
eval_transformed <- subset(eval_transformed, select = -ph)
#Setup cv
control <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 3, allowParallel = TRUE)
```

**MARS**

MARS is a versatile modeling method that successfully captures nonlinearities and variable interactions. Preparation entails scaling and centring the data to standardize feature scales to focus on discovering significant interactions and trends without being influenced by different variable scales.  
Trained using earth method with a parameter grid specifying degrees and number of pruning terms (nprune). Centering and scaling were applied to normalize the variables. 
MARS builds models by generating piecewise linear splines, which are especially useful for dealing with complex, non-linear interactions that may be present in data from various manufacturing processes. To avoid overfitting, the model starts with the maximum number of basis functions and prunes them using the generalized cross-validation criterion. 

The best model, with a degree of 2 and 20 pruning terms, showed an RMSE of 0.1269, R-squared of 0.459, and MAE of 0.0960 on the training set, indicating moderate predictive accuracy. mnf_flow was the most influential, followed by variables like brand_code.C, and hyd_pressure3, suggesting these factors are critical in predicting pH levels.

```{r mars_model}

**Support Vector Machine**

SVM data preparation involves scaling and centering, which are critical for this model because it creates a hyperplane in high-dimensional space to distinguish various classes. The scale of the data influences the hyperplane's location, and unscaled data might mislead the learning algorithm by emphasizing larger-scale elements disproportionately.

SVM is constructed by determining the best hyperplane that divides the classes with the greatest margin. It is resistant to outliers and effective in high-dimensional spaces. Kernel functions, such as the radial basis function utilized here, enable SVM to learn non-linear bounds, making it suitable for a variety of data patterns.

Achieved an RMSE of 0.1194, R-squared of 0.5236, and MAE of 0.0877, showing slightly better performance than MARS.

Illustrated less reliance on any single variable, with mnf_flow still significant but less dominant, showcasing SVM's distribution of importance across multiple features.

**Neural networks**

Data standardization is required for neural networks to learn efficiently. Scaling and centering reduce the dominance of higher magnitude features and improve gradient descent optimization by guaranteeing more uniform scaling across all inputs.

Neural networks are made up of layers of interconnected nodes, with each connection representing a weight; the nodes apply activation functions to their input data. Training entails altering these weights based on the difference between expected and actual results. The model utilized here, avNNet, is an ensemble of neural networks that stabilize predictions.

Noted for the best R-squared of 0.5586 among the models with an RMSE of 0.1145 and MAE of 0.0856, suggesting a strong fit.

Similar to SVM, shows a balanced importance across several predictors, highlighting the model's use of complex feature interactions.

**Gradient Boosting**

Scaling is not required for GBM preparation because the model is based on scale-invariant decision trees. However, centering and scaling are used here to ensure consistency in preprocessing across models, which aids in comparative model evaluation.

GBM transforms an ensemble of weak prediction models, often decision trees, into a strong learner in a sequential process. Each tree is designed to remedy mistakes in earlier trees. The learning process and model complexity are controlled by parameters such as the number of trees, tree depth, and learning rate.

Tuned over a range of tree numbers, interaction depths, and minimum observations in nodes, using a shrinkage factor to regulate learning.
 
Exhibited the best performance metrics in this set with an RMSE of 0.1102, R-squared of 0.5956, and MAE of 0.0830.

mnf_flow and brand_code.C were significant, along with other operational parameters, indicating their pivotal roles in pH level determination.

**Random Forest**

Random Forest models, like GBM, are tree-based and do not require data scaling. The data, however, is scaled and centered to ensure that the preparation methods are consistent across all models used in the research.

During training, Random Forest generates numerous decision trees and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of each tree. It is particularly effective for classification and regression, and its ensemble method allows it to handle overfitting very well.

Delivered the highest R-squared value of 0.7130, RMSE of 0.0963, and MAE of 0.0699, indicating excellent generalization.

Demonstrates significant contributions from operational variables like mnf_flow and oxygen_filler, aligning with expected impacts on pH.

# 4. Model Selection

Resampling metrics (RMSE, R², and MAE) from model training are compared to test metrics to evaluate overfitting and generalization capabilities.Models are judged on their predicted accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. The final decision (e.g., Random Forest with the best test metrics) is based on a combination of these criteria, with the goal of producing a model that performs well in a variety of circumstances.

The chosen model should meet operational needs such as ease of deployment, stakeholder interpretability, and long-term maintenance. Model performance should be checked over time using new data to verify that it continues to operate as expected under changing settings.

Based on the resampling (cross-validation) metrics and test metrics for each model, we can perform a detailed analysis to select the best model for predicting pH values.

Random Forest (RF) outperforms practically all metrics, especially in test metrics, where it has the lowest RMSE (0.0963) and the greatest R-squared (0.7130). The MAE is likewise the lowest among the models, at 0.0699, showing that RF predictions are relatively close to real values with less error on average.  
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) follows closely behind RF, with competitive scores, particularly in test R-squared (0.6445), indicating its resilience in dealing with the dataset's variation.  
Neural Network (NNet) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) both perform well, with NNet marginally outperforming in terms of resampling and testing metrics, giving it a viable alternative if ensemble approaches are eschewed.

While Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) are beneficial for capturing nonlinear interactions, their performance metrics fall behind those of the other models.

Because of their ensemble nature and iterative improvements, RF and GBM models may require careful adjustment to minimize overfitting. This category also includes NNet, which has a layered structure and the possibility for deep interactions. Compared to ensemble and neural network models, MARS and SVM are easier to interpret. If model explanation is important, these may be favored despite inferior performance. RF and GBM require more training time and resources than simpler models such as MARS or SVM. 
Given the findings, Random Forest is suggested for deployment due to its superior performance in all important measures. If there are limits on model transparency or processing resources, simpler models such as SVM or even NNet may be considered as alternatives. Further steps should include a rigorous validation process to confirm the RF model's stability, an investigation into feature engineering based on RF variable relevance, and potential ensemble procedures that could combine strengths from many models to improve prediction accuracy.
