# Overview

Assignment: This is role playing.  I am your new boss.  I am in charge of production at ABC Beverage and you are a team of data scientists reporting to me.  My leadership has told me that new regulations are requiring us to understand our manufacturing process, the predictive factors and be able to report to them our predictive model of PH.

Please use the historical data set I am providing. Build and report the factors in BOTH a technical and non-technical report.  I like to use Word and Excel. Please provide your non-technical report in a  business friendly readable document and your predictions in an Excel readable format. The technical report should show clearly the models you tested and how you selected your final approach.

Please submit both Rpubs links and .rmd files or other readable formats for technical and non-technical reports.  Also submit the excel file showing the prediction of your models for pH.

# 1. Data Exploration

## 1.1 Load data

- NAs:

Brand Code: ~4.7% missing in beverage_df, ~3.0% missing in eval_df.

Many numeric features have a small percentage of missing values, generally < 2%.

PH: No NAs, the target variable in beverage_df. eval_df has all values missing for PH (used for prediction).

Impute missing values for numeric features using median or mean (or more advanced imputation if correlated features exist). Missing values should be handled within a robust pipeline to avoid information loss.

Brand Code can be imputed or left as-is, depending on the percentage missing per brand.

- Skewness and outliers

Variables like Mnf Flow have extreme values (mean is heavily influenced by outliers). Range: -100.2 to 229.4.

PH: Check for extreme pH values that may affect model accuracy.

Hyd Pressure1â€“4: High standard deviations (e.g., Hyd Pressure2 with a mean of ~21 and SD of 16.4).

Analyze the distribution of these variables using histograms or boxplots. Maybe winsorization or BoxCox/log transformation for skewed distributions.

- Feature Importance for PH pred

Carb Volume, Fill Ounces, PC Volume, Carb Pressure, and Carb Temp have small sd and are likely controlled manufacturing parameters. These might directly influence pH.

Brand Code can be treated as a categorical predictor for brand-specific variations.

Correlation or feature importance to identify which variables most strongly influence PH.

- Brand Code: 4 levels (A, B, C, D).

Unbalanced distribution: B accounts for ~50% of records, while A, C, and D are much smaller. The imbalance might affect models like decision trees or ensemble methods.

Apply stratified sampling or weighting to handle imbalance during training. Explore interaction effects between Brand Code and numeric variables.

- Multicollinearity

Variables such as Carb Volume, PC Volume, and Carb Pressure might be correlated due to their role in carbonation.

Multiple pressure-related variables (Carb Pressure1, Fill Pressure, etc.) and filler speed/level metrics could also have collinear relationships.

Compute a correlation matrix to detect highly correlated predictors.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to handle multicollinearity.

- Data Leakage

Variables like PSC, PSC Fill, and PSC CO could be downstream measures dependent on pH. Confirm whether these are part of the production process or outcome metrics.

Analyze the production process to ensure no data leakage into the model.

- eval_df

All PH values are missing for prediction. Maybe remove this column for now.

Structure and missingness are similar to beverage_df. Ensure preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines are consistent between training and evaluation datasets.

- Feature engineering 

Ratios: Carb Volume / PC Volume (efficiency metrics)

Differences: Carb Pressure - Fill Pressure (pressure loss)

One-hot encoding for Brand Code

Binning continuous variables (e.g., temperature ranges)

I assume there is no timestamps, no need to add seasonality or shift-based features.

- Modeling Considerations

Use feature scaling:variables like Carb Flow and Filler Speed have very different ranges and should be normalized or scaled for models like SVM or neural networks.

If PH is skewed, maybe log or BoxCox transforms it for models sensitive to distribution (e.g., linear regression).
